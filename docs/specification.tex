\section*{Project Proposal}


Ammar Eltigani, Priya Rajbhandary
\subsection*{Q1.}
\textit{Islang Island}
\subsection*{Q3.}

\subsection*{Introduction}
Our proposed language is a sketching tool for \textbf{2D fantasy maps}. The language user can draw from a list of pre-defined shapes/structures or make their own and place them onto a 2D fantasy world canvas. The language supports specifying the magnitude, orientation, and scale of a shape/structure relative to others.

This tool would make the process of sketching fantasy maps for fiction or creative projects very accessible as it requires little knowledge of traditional coding or digital design tools. The ultimate goal is to provide the new user with a plethora of pre-defined shapes/structures they can immediately adopt and use. We envision (and hope that) this library of pre-defined resources will slowly grow through the contributions of the community of power users and developers.

\subsection*{Design Principles}

Aesthetically, the principal goal of this language is to enable users to design beautiful maps of fantasy lands, acting as a creative outlet for their imaginations. Technically, this language achieves this through a modular component-based design where smaller and simpler drawings can be combined to achieve more complex ones. A key technical design feature is that the user can draw components with specified orientation, scale, and position that are \textit{relative} to other components.

\subsection*{Examples}

\begin{verbatim}
//E.g.1
TwoCircles 50x50 is:
    circle  point=(5,5) radius=5
    circle  point=(5,5) radius=3
ThreeCircles 100x100 is:
    TwoCircles
    circle point=(10,10) radius=4


//E.g.2
SmallMountain 200x200 is:
    mountain
ThreeMountains 1000x1000 is:
    SmallMountain 1 units to the left
    SmallMountain
    SmallMountain 3 units to the right

    
//E.g.3
CloudCastle 50x200 is:
    cloud
    castle 1 units to the top
Newland 400x400 is:
    CloudCastle 1 units to the top-right
    mountain 4 units to the left rotated 270
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Language Concepts}

The core concepts of our language are the components that contain other components and/or primitives. The user builds components by nesting them together alongside (i) primitives at the bottom level, or (ii) pre-defined components.

The primitives we supply are
\begin{itemize}
    \item point
    \item circle
\end{itemize}
which we implement using the SVG library. We also hope to provide some very simple build-in components (combining forms) such as landmasses, islands, mountains, buildings, clouds, trees, shrubs, rods, bridges, etc. Users are encouraged to use these basic combining forms and/or primitives to create their own combining forms and build upon these components.

\subsection*{Syntax}

We define a partial BNF syntax for our language below:

\begin{lstlisting}
<point> ::= (<int>, <int>)

<circle> ::= circle <point> <int>

<name> ::= <str>

<dims> ::= <int> x <int>

<direction> ::= top | bottom | left | right | top-right
            | top-left | bottom-left | bottom-right
            
<position> ::= <int> unit to the <direction>

<orientation> ::= rotated <int>

<placement> ::= <position> | <orientation> | <position> <orientation> | $\epsilon$

<definition> ::= <name> <dims> <component>$^+$

<component> ::= <name> <orientation> <position>
         | <name> <placement>
         | <point>
         | <circle> <placement>
         | island <placement> 
         | mountain <placement>
         | castle <placement>
         | cloud <placement>

<canvas> ::= <definition>$^+$

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Semantics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(i)] We think of the primitives in our language as the set of landscape primitives we provide the user like trees, mountains, castles, etc. We wish to enable the user to draw primitives using relative placement and scaling that is a function of the bonding box or ``definition" of an object. Simply stated, an object in our language is just a box that contains multiple primitives or other objects. For example, looking at the second example program we provide, \verb|SmallMoutain| is an object that is comprised just of one mountain in the center of a box of \verb|200x200| and \verb|ThreeMountains| is another such object that contains three copies of \verb|SmallMountain|.
    
    \item[(ii)] As stated previously, our \textit{values} are components and they are combined by being placed into each other with relativistic spatial specifications. The \textit{evaluation} of our program involves recursively unpacking this tree of nested components are drawing the primitives in the leaf components within the dimension bounds defined by the parent components.

    \item[(iii)] As shown in textbf{example 2}, in our language users need at least two definitions to draw the map. So the initial definitions like SmallMountain are composed of components like mountains. This is because the last definition in this case ThreeMountains, which the user defines, can only use earlier definitions like SmallMountain as variables.

    \item[(iv)] Some of the F\# Algebraic Data Types we will use are the following:

    \begin{verbatim}
type Point = {x: int; y: int}

type Dims = {w: int; h: int}

type Direction =
| Top
| Right
| Bottom
| Left
| TopRight
| TopLeft
| BottomRight
| BottomLeft

type Position = Position of Direction * int

type Placement =
| RelativePlacement of Position * int
| AbsPlacement of Point * Dims * int

type Component =
| Name of string * Placement
| Circle of Point * int
| Island of Placement
| Mountain of Placement
| Castle of Placement
| Cloud of Placement

type Definition = {name: string; dims: Dims; components: Component list}

type Canvas = Canvas of Definition list

    \end{verbatim}

    In summary, every definition of a component will correspond to an SVG text wrapper function that is edited at each level in the inclusion of components as the evaluator makes its way to the outmost component, which we call the \texttt{canvas}. This wrapper function is first created at the lowest level where we have our primitives and is edited based on relativistic parameters at each level going up in the AST. Once we evaluator reaches the last definition string then we simply output the current versions of SVG for all our definitions to a file.
